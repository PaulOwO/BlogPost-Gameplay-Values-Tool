# Technical Blogpost On my First Tool !

## Introduction

This Tool was made in the last part of the first module GPR5100 of the second year in gammes programming at SAE Institute. The purpose of the tool is to help the third year with everything related to gameplay values in their city building game called Volyday made on Unreal. The tool was divided in 3 parts : Data base, Simulator and Editor. The third year student referent on the tool was Solange that helped and gived feedback all along the way.   

## Data Base

We had free choice of the format of the data base, after researching we choose to do it on an exel file (google sheets for multiple person to work on it at the same time)
We choose this because it can export the data on .csv format that unreal can easely read to make a data table.

### What's a .csv file ?

Here is what our data base looked like on google sheets

and here is what it looks like in .csv format.

A Comma-separated values format like it's name implies, separate the data in our sheets by comma.



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PaulOwO/BlogPost-Gameplay-Values-Tool/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
